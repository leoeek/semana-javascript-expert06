    - [ ] Must deliver static files as Node.js Streams
    - [ ] Must deliver music files as a Node.js Stream
    - [ ] Given a disconnected user it should not break the API
    - [ ] Even if multiple commands are fired at the same time, it should not break the API
    - [ ] If an unexpected error occurs, the API should keep working

    - Client
        - [ ] Must play the broadcast

## Tasks per class

- Lesson 01: Cover service and route layers with unit tests and achieve 100% code coverage
- Lesson 02: Maintain 100% code coverage and implement e2e tests for the entire API
- Lesson 03: implement unit tests for the frontend and maintain 100% code coverage
- **PLUS**:
    - [ ] provide a new effect
        - [ ] add a new button on the controller
        - [ ] add a new effect sound to the `audios/fx/` folder

## FAQ
- `NODE_OPTIONS` is not a system recognized command, what to do?
    - If you are on Windows, the way to create environment variables is different. You must use the word `set` before the command.
    - Ex: ` "test": "set NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules && npx jest --runInBand",`

- I ran `npm test` but nothing happens, what to do?
    - Check your Node.js version. We are using version 17. Go to [node.js website](https://nodejs.org) and download the latest version.

- `jest.spyOn` - when we try to use `function.name` (something like `stream.pipe.name`), it says the instance is undefined
    - In this case, use the value as a string: `jest.spyOn(stream, "pipe").mockReturnValue`
- Challenge 01 impossible to complete 100% code coverage because [testUtil.js](./aulas/aula01/tests/unit/_util/testUtil.js) is not being fully used
    - Add the following code snippet to the first line of the [testUtil.js](./aulas/aula01/tests/unit/_util/testUtil.js) file: `/* istanbul ignore file */` . This will make jest ignore this file and complete 100%.
    - Important: this change will only serve to complete this first and/or second challenge, in the last class, we will not need to ignore this file since we will use all the functions
